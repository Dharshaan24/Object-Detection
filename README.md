Moving object detection involves identifying objects that are in motion. It aims to distinguish between moving objects and stationary areas or regions.
By segmenting the moving objects from the background,we can track their motion and analyze it later1.
Algorithmic Steps:
Background Subtraction: The initial step in moving object detection is background subtraction. It helps separate the moving objects from the static background.
Global Thresholding: Thresholding techniques are applied to create binary masks, highlighting the moving regions.
Erosion and Dilation: These morphological operations help refine the binary masks by removing noise and filling gaps.
Contour Detection: Extracting contours from the binary masks allows us to identify the boundaries of moving objects.
Filtering: Applying filters or rules to eliminate false positives or irrelevant detections.
Bounding Box Prediction: Finally, bounding boxes are drawn around the moving objects to indicate their location and extent
